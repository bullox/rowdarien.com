## About Darien

Darien is a solo ocean rowing boat, built in 2014 by Justin Adkin of [Sea Sabre](http://sea-sabre.com). She's pretty and practical and is looking for rowers to treat her right and take her places.

## Design

Phil Morrison classic hull, with various custom features for the discerning rower, including:

* Short deck for increased rower protection and greater cabin space.
* Poop deck hatch for drogue and sea anchor stowage -- no clambering over the roof or getting a wet cabin!

## Construction

Fibreglass hull, marine ply deck and cabins. Solid as a rock, but much more floaty. Capsize tested in Bristol harbour, ocean tested in the mad Pacific. One careful owner, super-shiny.
