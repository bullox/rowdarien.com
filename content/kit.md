What you get when you charter Darien:

* Possibly the best solo ocean rowing boat in the world.
* Fully kitted out with excellent Garmin nav & comms kit.
* Loads of safety stuff including liferaft, life jacket, harness, beacons, etc.
* Super robust Katadyn watermaker with manual handle -- filters interchangeable with Katadyn's hand-pumped models.
* Excess solar power -- no fear of running out of juice on a cloudy day
* Deck speakers for banging tunes and lovely audio books
* Massive list of included kit -- more details coming soon
