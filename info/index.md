# About Darien

Darien is a solo ocean rowing boat, available by charter with a large list of additional kit. We think that she is the best around – top-notch design and construction, tried-and-tested design updated with some fantastic and convenient features. She's pretty and practical and is looking for rowers to treat her right and take her places.

# Design

Designed by world-renowned [Phil Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Morrison_%28yachts%29), with numerous innovative features to enable a solo rower to work safely and effectively.

Classic hull, with various custom features for the discerning rower, including:

* Short deck for increased rower protection and greater cabin space.
* Poop deck hatch for drogue and sea anchor stowage -- no clambering over the roof or getting a wet cabin!

# Construction

Built in 2014 by Justin Adkin of [Sea Sabre](http://sea-sabre.com/). Fibreglass hull, marine ply deck and cabins. Solid as a rock, but much more floaty. Capsize tested in Bristol harbour, Darien has withstood the worst the Pacific can throw at her, coming out with barely a scratch. She's super-shiny.
